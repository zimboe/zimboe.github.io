title:  "thoughts on ttrpg backlogs"
---

I love tabletop role playing games (tt-rpg). Of course playing in a game, in person or online with friends; or strangers at a connection or meetup. Then running games. One shots or campaigns running months and months.

I like old games and new. Games that explore areas of storys and drama not really addressed in the first decades of the hobby. But also games that want to cut back and recapture the (remembered or misremembered) experience of the good old days.

There used to be a time where one could know and play all the games published and available. But with the explosion of available and the (encouraging) lowered barrier of drivethrurpg and itch, there are so many more games than one can stay on top of. Then there are bundles on itch, which could mean hundreds of new games.

So it's easier than ever to end up with a huge pile of games that you might be interested in, but have not read or played.

But this is not a new thing at all.

Let my digrees a bit. Having novels littering the place that you will not get around to reading in your lifetime is something very very ok in my book. Same, to a lesser degree are movies. With music I wouldn't quite understand it. (That makes more sense when looking at physical media. A watch/listen to next list in a streaming platform doesn't have the weight of a reading backlog to me. The pocket (nee "read it later") list I have ammassed to me feels almost entierly like a cached bookmark list and not really like the books I bought for reading.

Back to RPG books

Buying and owning RPG books always meant something else compared to fiction or non-fiction books.

*    RPG books can be enjoyed for the books they are. Blades in the Dark, Mouse Guard, and most recently Deathmatch Island are beautyful artifacts to handle and page through. The Free League games share a lot of DNA with coffee table books; and it is very much appreciated!

*    Reading an RPG book can be fun and rewarding and eye opening. Even if you never intend to run or even play the game. Guidence on how to actually play any given game is to this day a very hard thing to convecy. And most books are basically not able to teach you. (Aside: We used to say that you can't tell someone what TTRPGs are. You have to play in one. Nowadays that is no longer the case. You can watch/listen to endless hours of actual play streams/podcasts; that being said, there is something to this little nugget I came across a couple of times in the last years: Playing RPGs around your table at home relates to TTRPG streams roughly like average people sleeping with each other relates to porn.)

*    Even if you search for, order, read, re-read, study, prepare for (do prep) a given TT-RPG, chances are you will never play it. The group you have might not want to play mice, despite your conviction that they would love the harsh reality of being a Mouse Guard. Or the group that would play the game splits up or is on indefinite hiatus because life. Or you know that you would need to be pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone to run that particular game and now you don't feel like taking on that challenge.

*    I have plenty of RPG books that I would have fun running... if the stars align: Right set of player, players interested in the games pitch, me being in the mood for this games vibe (prepping grimdark games can weigh on your mood!), me feeling up to commit to the prep time and enery the game would need. But --and this is the thing!-- if the situation never arrises, I'm still fine with having spent whatever time I spent enjoying the books.

*    Rereading a game after you played it is also something that surprised me. I did this with Blades in the Dark. And there what is the game experience in play was vivid in my head. Rereading the book put in stark relief where the book is guiding (almost enfocing) play exprience though design vs what happened on our table. As well as how much of the game elements made it into play at our table; very few designers will take all tools in the toolbox that is the game into play; and thus home tables should also not feel forced to do "everything by the book".

*    When you buy an RPG book you are making a statement and support not only the creators but also make hobby a tiny bit more viable. And I adore a lot of the smaller and less known books/zines/one page pdfs I sometimes find. It's great that they exist and what width of expression and exploration of possibilities they existance represents. That is worth celebrating.

So, in summary: I cherrish the TT-RPG books I have. Those that I have run of course have the stories I remember from play. So they are standing out. And some I might hope to run or wonder how it is I never did run them. But none of them weigh on me in the way a TODO list item might.

Let's compare them to places in the world. There a some may places I would love to visit and experience myself. But in my lifetime I will only visit so many of them. Still I love, that I can think and dream of them.

Mood check-in I like writing about this. Not sure if I will revisit this post, or posts in general or leave things as I typed them.

PS:
I might some day write post with my current TT-RPG backlog. That is what the original title of this post suggested to me. Maybe.
