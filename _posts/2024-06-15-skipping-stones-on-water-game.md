# skipping stones on water game

2024-Jun-15

This is a game I like to play with the kids when we are vacationing by the sea.

The main idea is this: You starting score is one. Find a stone you deem likely to skip well.

Then the throw: Then stand in the water near the beach. Skip the stone. Count how often it jumps in the water. Multiply the number of jumps with your current score. Now you have to find the stone again. Repeat throws until you can't find the stone or throw results in not a single jump at all (your score is and always will be zero).

There are many ways this game gets easier or harder by the second:

*    The wind picks up or changes
*    Other bathers block the opportune direction (between wave crests where the sea is almost flat)
*    People or currents cause the water to be murky; making it much more difficult  to find the stone again

One nice way to alter the game is to require the thrower to dive from the throwing spot and find the stone without comming up for air (or comming up for air only a certain, low number of times)

There is a nice trade-off between throwing flat and forceful, but also far and making sure you know pretty well where the stone sank.

I never played this in a lake. The water in small lakes will be much more easy to skip on, but the water is usually way murkier that the sea.

While I like the idea of skipping close to someone you play with, the risk to hit someone is too high for me to entertain on my vacations. But skipping and finding alternatingly is fun for me and one of my kids.

I also like this quality of the game: It is soft. Counting jumps is never precise. So two people might come up with counts that might differ by two or more. But the crucial difference between one or no jump basically never is a point of contention.

So there it is. A small game I enjoy and maybe noone ever came up with this. (Although I doubt it.)

After writing this I had a look at the Wikipedia page. Full of small delights.
