# What to expect

Random musings and partially documented deeper thoughts

# What not to expect

Overly polished or serious content.

Post that are aiming at a certain audience. I don't really expect there is a good fit for the quasi-random thoughts I pour into these pages. So maybe someone find a post they like. Maybe they look around. But this will not be to please an audience. This is not content that has to drive some metric.
